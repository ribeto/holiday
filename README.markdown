Happy Holidays
* * *

I decided to play around with html 5 and canvas in lue of the season.

Details 
* * *
* Play / pause at stop / starts the audio track

* The middle button stops the snow fall

* The last button launches an html 5 video of a ski trip I took a few years back

* Clicking and dragging the general area of the canvas starts adds snowflakes when snow fall is enabled

* * *
I used jquery and threejs which are pretty rad
